**PREREQUISITES:**

- Python     >= 3.5 
- NumPy      >= 1.8.0
- SciPy      >= 0.14.0
- matplotlib >= 1.3.0

The following free scientific Python distributions include these prerequisites:

- *Continuum Anaconda*
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- *Enthought Canopy*
https://assets.enthought.com/downloads/edm/

**For ACBN0 and PAOFLOW capabilities:**

- PAOFLOW >= 2.0.10
https://github.com/marcobn/PAOFLOW
- mpi4py >= 2.0

**INSTALLATION:**

To install AFLOWpi, execute this command in the AFLOWpi source directory:

1. Clone this repository and enter the cloned directory
2. python setup.py install --user

with the --user flag optional depending on the setup of your python distribution.

**AFLOWpi can also be installed easily onto linux based systems via pip:**

pip install AFLOWpi

**GETTING STARTED:**
 
The examples directory in the AFLOWpi source directory contains example scripts. 
- AFLOWpi config must be modified to point to the proper executable directories of the calculation engine(s) being used. 
- Once the AFLOWpi config file is properly setup for the computer environment, to start the example, run them as python executables. 


**FOR ACBN0:**

Quantum Espresso must be modified and recompiled for ACBN0 to work properly. The files needed are located in engine_mods directory.
